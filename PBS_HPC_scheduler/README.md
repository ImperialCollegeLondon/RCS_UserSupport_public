This section will be populated in time and it contains useful User tips and info for using the batch scheduler that runs on IC HPC Services.

The scheduler name is PBS () and the terms "scheduler" "batch scheduler" and "PBS" will be used in this section and possibly throughout the Repository docs interchangeably.

When in doubt please consult the manual pages of the command you are trying to run, by using these [TIPS](/RCS-HPC_guides/coding/Nix-manPages.md)
