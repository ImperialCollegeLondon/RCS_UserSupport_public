videos and resources on Jupyter notebooks and why you should learn "how to code properly" in 2022 :

insightful articles:

## Data science

Ref:
[Python Data Science Tutorials](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/)

“Data science” is just about as broad of a term as they come. It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components:

**Data exploration & analysis**    

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/)  
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/)  
- [Python 3.x Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
- [Python 2.7 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/)

**Data visualization**  
(turning data into something colorful)  

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)  
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)  
- [Datashader](https://datashader.org/getting_started/)
- [others](https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/)   

**Classical machine learning**  
(supervised/unsupervised learning tasks; NOT deep learning).

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  
  - classification
  - regression
  - clustering
  - dimensionality reduction


- [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)  
(lots of useful features, less actively developed)  


**Deep learning**  
(subset of ML - machine learning. massively improved over the last few years)

- [Keras](https://keras.io)  
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)  
- [AlexNet](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) (the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers - 2012)
- others  

**Data storage and big data frameworks**  
(Big data is best defined as data that is either literally too large to reside on a single machine, or can’t be processed in the absence of a distributed environment.
The Python bindings to Apache technologies play heavily here).

- Apache Spark  
- Apache Hadoop  
- Hadoop File System (HDFS)  
- Dask  
- h5py/pytables  

**Odds and ends**  
(natural language processing, image manipulation, tasks that use libraries such as OpenCV etc..).
