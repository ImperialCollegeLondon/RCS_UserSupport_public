videos and resources on Jupyter notebooks and why you should learn "how to code properly" in 2022 :

from JupyterCon 2018 :  
[I don't like notebooks - Joel Grus (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U)


Reddit Platform :  
"programming subreddit"
(so you are getting a lot of answers from developers and engineers)  
[Notebooks suck: change my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/spxim1/notebooks_suck_change_my_mind/)

## Data science

Ref:
[Python Data Science Tutorials](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/)

“Data science” is just about as broad of a term as they come. It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components:

**Data exploration & analysis**    

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/)  
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/)  
- [Python 3.x Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
- [Python 2.7 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/)

**Data visualization**  
(turning data into something colorful)  

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)  
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)  
- [Datashader](https://datashader.org/getting_started/)
- [others](https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/)   

**Classical machine learning**  
(supervised/unsupervised learning tasks; NOT deep learning).

- Scikit-learn  (classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction)  
- StatsModels (lots of useful features, less actively developed)  


**Deep learning**  
(subset of ML - machine learning. massively improved over the last few years)

- [Keras](https://keras.io)  
- TensorFlow  
- [AlexNet](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) (the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers - 2012)
- others  

**Data storage and big data frameworks**  
(Big data is best defined as data that is either literally too large to reside on a single machine, or can’t be processed in the absence of a distributed environment.
The Python bindings to Apache technologies play heavily here).

- Apache Spark  
- Apache Hadoop  
- Hadoop File System (HDFS)  
- Dask  
- h5py/pytables  

**Odds and ends**  
(natural language processing, image manipulation, tasks that use libraries such as OpenCV etc..).  

- nltk  
- Spacy  
- OpenCV/cv2
- scikit-image  
- Cython
