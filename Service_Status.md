We invite (and strongly advise) users to check the Status of the HPC Services
- before running important jobs/workflows (or anything that could be impacted by Systems downtime - either planned or casual)
- as well performing any intensive IO Data operations (file synching, copyin etc.. ) as data loss may incur due to File Systems outages or Hardware issues.

You can check the status of the services by navigating to the page below :

**[ IC_VPN | Campus Network ]** --> https://selfservice.rcs.imperial.ac.uk/service-status

NOTES:

- if the page does NOT load at all, you may have connectivity or VPN-connection issues. (please seek advise with the Service/Help Desk, quoting: VPN issues in the title of the ticket)

- if the page loads you should be able to keep an eye on the status of the services provided.
