with reference to the HPC / RCS clinics  

Should you prefer a face-to-face chat approach, our door is open every Tuesday for our weekly drop-in session;  

these are called [RCS Clinics](https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/HPC/Attend+a+clinic)

They can be booked by Using the provided link in those pages.

Attendees should install or make sure to have installed [MS Teams](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/office-365/apps/microsoft-teams/)  on the date of the appointment.  

Sometimes (depending on the version and/or type of the Operating System used) - especially the Web-Application version of this program is used (i.e. MS Teams accessible via Web Browser) - it has been seen having limited functionality (e.g. do not allow screen-sharing etc.)

You should receive on Mondays or on Tuesday mornings a _clinics reminder notification_ if you are already part of our users-list.  


> NOTEs :   
>  - calendar bookings may become "open" on **Mondays** or **Tuesday morning(s) ONLY**.  
>  - kindly do NOT report issues with the booking system on other days.
