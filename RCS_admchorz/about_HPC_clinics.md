Should you prefer a face-to-face chat approach, our door is open every Tuesday for our weekly drop-in session;  

these are called [RCS Clinics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/attend-a-clinic/)

They can be booked by [Using this calendar link](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ResearchComputingService1@ImperialLondon.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/)  
and attended by using [MS Teams](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/office-365/apps/microsoft-teams/)  on the date of the appointment.  

You should receive on Mondays or on Tuesday mornings a _clinics reminder notification_ if you are already part of our users-list.  


> NOTEs :   
>  - calendar bookings may become "open" on **Mondays** or **Tuesday morning(s) ONLY**.
