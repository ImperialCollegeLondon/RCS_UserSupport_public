Please report your issues by using one of the methods available from the [IC ICT RCS - ASK Platform link](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/help/)  

For issues related to **RCS HPC Job problem or application errors** or at least so perceived,
please submit a request using the form at the link [ASK Support Form](https://servicemgt.imperial.ac.uk/ask?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9628c3e81bff7810d96ceb91b24bcb89)  


in addition to what is asked in the form above
**please make sure to always include** and specify a bit of context, and the following information which is vital for quick troubleshooting

these are vital if your workspace is not tidy, version controlled and/or you continuously need to edit files and filenames as we see in most cases :  

- **jobID**    
- **filename of the of the job-script / submission-script used** (with explicit version name if they use one!)
- **absolute path location of the job-script**    
- **absolute path location of ERROR and OUTPUT logs** (if these are not in any of the folders already mentioned above!)

**! IMPORTANT !**  
If you want us to perform a quick and efficient troubleshooting   
Please **DO NOT move, delete, or rename any/previous jobs' error/output files**  
(even if these were created by failed jobs!)   

If we need to investigate further issues, we may need to be able to check your `job-scripts` and what SW, input and output files you are running and pinpoint this to particular times/dates;  deleting or moving files around will not only incur in Support and troubleshooting delays but it will contribute in making the whole process frustrating for both users and analysts.   

Thanks for your time, understanding and collaboration.
