Please report your issues by using one of the methods available from the [IC ICT RCS - ASK Platform link](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/help/)  

For issues related to **RCS HPC Job problem or application errors** or at least so perceived,
please submit a request using the form at the link [ASK Support Form](https://servicemgt.imperial.ac.uk/ask?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9628c3e81bff7810d96ceb91b24bcb89)  


in addition to what is asked in the form above
**please make sure to always include** and specify a bit of context, and the following information which is vital for quick troubleshooting

these are vital if your workspace is not tidy, version controlled and/or you continuously need to edit files and filenames as we see in most cases :  

- **jobID**    
- **name of the file** of your job-script/submission-script  
- **absolute path location of the job-script**    


Please make sure to **NOT delete any previous job error/output files** created by failed jobs, if you want us to be able to perform troubleshooting/fault analysis in an efficient way.

If we need to investigate further issues, we may need to be able to check your `job-scripts` and what SW, input and output files you are running and pinpoint this to particular times/days so deleting or moving files around will not only incur in Support and troubleshooting delays but making the whole process frustrating for both users and analysts.   

Thanks for your time, understanding and collaboration.
