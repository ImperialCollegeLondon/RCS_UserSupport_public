
## HPC New starter


Thank you for getting in touch with our Research Computing Tech support Team.

**Senior Permanent Academic members of Staff** are empowered to
- enroll _students_ and _staff members_ on the HPC Services, under their supervision.
- grant them access to the HPC systems.

Kindly ask your supervisor to refer to the [Self Service Portal](https://selfservice.rcs.imperial.ac.uk/registration/hpc)  

> NOTE:  
 this resource is ONLY accessible to users via internal network or IC VPN)

If the Supervisors have not yet registered already themselves in turn, they will need to do so first (before managing your access) by accepting the Services' T&C's.  
Thereafter they will be presented with their delegated access group, which they will use to enroll their supervised users.  

To grant you access to the HPC systems, they will need to add you to their "delegated HPC access group" by searching for your CID or username and pressing add.

Note that the account creation process can take up to 24 hours to complete.
You will receive an email upon successful enrollment containing some more details, information and a link to our "Getting Started" guide.
