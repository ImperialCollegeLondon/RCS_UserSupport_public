**NOTES :**

Please note that some video guides (may become quickly outdate for your OS version or whenever new infrastructure changes, processes and procedures get implemented on our end).

Finally, please note that, as systems and architectures evolve, we may need to change IPs, server names, mounting/exporting paths of remote mounts etc.. further issues may arise because of these operations, especially when changes do not get widely and openly communicated on time to users.

We always ask our users to kindly be patient as we are working hard to improve systems, services, processes and procedures (... and Documentation whenever possible).

I will try to integrate the repo with more guides and docs as soon as I am able to find a bit more time.
