#### Access/mount RDS


Simple Video Tutorials on how to mount/access Research Computing - RDS Systems (Research Data Storage)
from various Client Operating Systems.

I will integrate vith guides and docs as soon as I am able to find a bit more time.

Please note that some guides (especially the video- tutorials may be out of date)

also systems may need to change IPs, server names and paths of remote mounts, so furhter issues may arise because of this.
