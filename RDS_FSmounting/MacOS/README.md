Please remember that :

**whenever remote drives are mounted locally**

- changing network  
- changing Wi-Fi HotSpot  
- disconnecting and reconnecting to the network  

may make your remote connection unstable, unusable or even make it fail (this may incur in data corruption or even data loss, if you have open files for instance).

For this and other reasons, we advise users to **always unmount the drives** when their workflow is finished and **remount them back** whenever they need them again.

Finally Please always make sure to

**unmount any remotely-mounted drive (HPC, RDS etc..) BEFORE changing your main IC account passwords!**

this will prevent accessibility issues and avoid any Microsoft account profile related  lockouts, due to cached passwords, expired credentials, stale connections etc.
