#### GH REPO DISCLAIMER:

This repository may contain various pieces of **information**, technical and non technical **advice**, **guides** , **templates** and  **examples**  

that are purely based upon the **personal experiences**, **tastes**, **preferences**, **knowledge**, **usage of tools** and operating systems etc. of the main contributor writer.  

Some pages or links are known to have been made expire, and some others may or may be NOT subject to future **revision**, **expiration** etc.

Some links may still return a 404 Error (this last behavior has been seen particularly on those links that point to the main website pages; this is not due to this Repo itself).  

As things change over time, I will try my best to keep the documentation current, free from typos and errors and updated at best of my knowledge and possibilities.   

I still believe that this repository provides a good source of information and references for and to many users.  

Please always make sure to double check first the official IC documentation that the RCS Team presents through their main channels, websites and wiki pages.

Thank you for your time and understanding and happy browsing :)
