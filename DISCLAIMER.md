#### GH REPO DISCLAIMER:

This repository may contain various pieces of advice, information, guides and examples
that are purely based upon the personal experiences, tastes, preferences, knowledge, usage of tools and operating systems etc. of the main contributor(s).
Some pages or links may have expired, may be subject to future revision or expiration and/or return a 404 Error
(this last behaviour has been seen especially for those links that point to the main website pages; this is not due to the Repo itself).
As things change over time, I will try my best to keep the documentation current and updated at best.
I still believe this repo is a good source for User's info, references and for having a bunch of technical docs, templates and examples, to understand how things work.
Please always make sure to double check first the official documentation that the RCS Team presents through their main channels, websites and wiki pages.
Thank you for your time and understanding and happy browsing :)
